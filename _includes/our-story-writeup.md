On February 6, 2017, twenty Zionist and progressive activists crowded into the living room of a small apartment in Manhattan's Financial District. Through our discussion one thing became clear: too many of our fellow progressives are not inspired by the beauty and morality of Zionism. We want to change that. Zionism, like all great civil rights campaigns, was a march towards freedom, justice, and equality. After many months of dialogue we realized we needed to act. We refuse to forfeit our terminology and our identities. Our hope is to articulate Zionism as the moral, humanitarian, and progressive cause that it is. With an understanding of Zionist history, philosophy, and literature, we hope to reclaim and reaffirm Zionist as a progressive cause. Wonâ€™t you join us?
