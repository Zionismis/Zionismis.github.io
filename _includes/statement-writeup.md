<small><i>In all our activism and conversations, <b>Zionism.is</b> holds ourselves to the following principles and conduct:</i></small>
 
<b>We</b> recognize that the Zionist movement and the State of Israel are rooted in inherently progressive values which include equality, justice, inclusion, and the overall improvement of the human condition. 

<b>We</b> are liberals and progressives, and therefore are committed to preserving a pluralistic and inclusive learning environment centered on thoughtful, considerate, empathetic, open and civil discourse.

<b>We</b> recognize that true learning occurs in an environment of diverse ideas and dialectical conversation, where discourse transcends hollow rhetoric and complicates, rather than simplifies, the conversation.

<b>We</b> believe that a multidimensional understanding of Zionist and Israeli history, literature, and philosophy is necessary for any individual who seeks to grasp Israel or Zionism today.

<b>We</b> support truthful and constructive pathways to a just and lasting peace which respects the aspirations, dignity, and security of all peoples.

<b>We</b> do not tolerate any attempt to demonize or delegitimize any group or individual based on race, religion, nationality, or nonviolent political beliefs or affiliation.
